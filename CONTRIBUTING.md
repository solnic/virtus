# Current project status

Virtus recently hit it's 1.0 release (2013-10-16). The focus now is on bug-fixes and maintenance while [@solnic][solnic] is away from the project. An experimental branch will be kept up-to date where proposed features and API changes can be made. Please direct your questions and issues to [@elskwid][elskwid], the maintainer.

# Contributing to Virtus

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Run `rubocop -a` to fix any Ruby style issues and re-run `rubocop --auto-gen-config` for any acceptable exceptions.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or version
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
